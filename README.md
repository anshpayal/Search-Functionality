# Search Functionality Assignment
I have build the search functionality using Youtube search API.

### Functionality
- [x] List of seach result in a paginated view with 5 results per page. 
- [x] Load more button to allow user to load the next set of results.
- [x] The search suggestions automatically visible when user type.
- [x] Caching the results on FE for a particular query.
- [x] Only making API call after the user has at least typed 3 characters.
- [x] 200ms Debouncing
- [x] Look and feel like smallcase website.


### Tech stack
- React
- Create react app
- Allowed to use a css library for look and feel (Tailwind)
- Used Axios for actual search results api (YouTube API).
